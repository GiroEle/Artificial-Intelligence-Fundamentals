**lab1**: This lab is a warm up to get you used to the programming environment used in the course, and also to help you review and renew your knowledge of Python and relevant Python libraries.

**lab2**: Trained a convolutional neural network to classify an image into one of two classes: "cat" or "dog". 

**lab4** Used a variation of a denoising autoencoder to solve a data imputation problem. An autoencoder will be trained using inputs that have one categorical feature artificially removed, and the goal of the autoencoder is to correctly reconstruct all features, including the one removed from the input.

**Font_Project**: Developed my own project with a partner to classify fonts from images of text. Created our own dataset of text images. Implemented a CNN as the architecture.
